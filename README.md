# üìä QUANT FINANCE CASE STUDIES

Rigorous, end-to-end quantitative finance case studies spanning derivatives pricing, portfolio construction, risk management, volatility modeling, and machine learning for markets. Each study includes clear problem framing, mathematical formulation, robust implementation, and empirical evaluation.

## üéØ Purpose

- Document real-world quant workflows as reproducible case studies.
- Bridge theory to practice with institutional-grade rigor.
- Provide clean, parameterized code and explainable results for interviews, research, and production prototyping.

## üìö Documentation

- docs/math: derivations, assumptions, model diagrams
- docs/case_studies: narratives, figures, and result interpretation
- In-notebook references to methods and further reading

---

## üß™ Testing


- Unit tests for core routines (pricing, Greeks, optimizers)
- Regression tests for calibration routines
- Seeded simulations for reproducibility

---

## üß± Data Policy

- No large datasets committed.
- Use small samples/synthetic data under data/ for structure only.
- For full experiments, use environment variables or config files to point to local or vendor data sources.

---

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome:
- Add new case studies with clear structure and metrics
- Improve calibration routines and numerical stability
- Extend backtesting and risk modules
- Enhance documentation and tests

Please:
- Follow PEP 8, type-hint critical APIs
- Include tests and notebook outputs (light figures ok, avoid heavy artifacts)
- Add math notes if introducing new models
